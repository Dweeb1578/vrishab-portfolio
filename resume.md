# Featured Product Decks
## ECOX LABS (Agri-Waste Supply Chain)
* **Problem:** India faces a dual crisis: 1.6 million deaths annually from air pollution due to crop burning, and a lack of scalable supply chains for industries needing biomass. Startups fail because they cannot reliably source agri-waste.
* **Solution:** Built a tech-enabled, decentralized supply chain to aggregate, process, and deliver agri-waste to industries.
    * **KhetSe App:** Designed a mobile app for farmers to geo-tag locations and schedule waste pickups, digitizing the "first mile" of logistics.
    * **IoT Warehousing:** Implemented smart inventory systems to monitor moisture levels and stock in real-time, ensuring raw material quality.
    * **Blockchain Traceability:** Created an immutable ledger to track waste movement from farm to factory, ensuring transparency for ESG investors.
* **Commercial Viability:** Modeled positive unit economics with a processing cost of ₹1,800-3,000/ton vs. a market selling price of ₹5,000-7,000/ton for biomass briquettes.
* **Launch Strategy:** Focused initial rollout in Ludhiana due to high paddy generation and proximity to bioenergy plants.

## FinEase (Fintech for Gig Economy)
* **Problem:** India's 23.5M gig workers struggle with income variability, lack of financial literacy, and debt traps. Existing fintech apps are too complex, English-centric, and require manual data entry, making them unusable for this demographic.
* **Solution:** Designed a "Save-Track-Learn" ecosystem tailored specifically for gig workers.
    * **Automated Tracking:** Built logic to parse SMS/UPI alerts from gig platforms (Zomato/Swiggy) to auto-log income without manual input.
    * **Gamified Education:** Created a "TikTok for Finance" module delivering short, regional-language video lessons on taxes and savings, incentivized with in-app coins.
    * **Inclusive UX:** Designed an "Offline-First" architecture and voice-assisted interface to support users with low-end devices and limited literacy.
* **Business Model:** B2B2C strategy partnering with platforms like Swiggy/Uber for distribution, monetized via ethical ad revenue, micro-course sales, and anonymized credit scoring data for lenders.
* **North Star Metric:** "Financial Confidence Score" — a composite metric tracking active budgeting, savings goal adherence, and educational module completion.

## Blinkit (Churn Prediction & Flexi-Delivery)
* **Problem:** Identified high customer churn rates driven by "Billing Delays" (44% weightage) and "Support Calls" (16% weightage). Root cause analysis revealed 65% of support calls stemmed from poor product quality (damaged/missing items).
* **Analysis:** Trained a Random Forest ML model on customer datasets to quantify churn factors, identifying that users valued quality reliability over speed in specific segments.
* **Solution:** Proposed "Flexi-Delivery," a dual-mode checkout interface:
    * **Lightning Lane:** Standard 10-minute delivery optimized for proximity.
    * **Careful Cart:** Quality-prioritized delivery sourced from the highest-rated vendors (ignoring distance), ensuring freshness for sensitive items.
* **Vendor Incentive:** Designed a dynamic commission model where vendors with high quality ratings pay lower commissions, gamifying inventory standards.
* **Projected Impact:** Targeted a 40% reduction in quality-related support tickets and refund-based billing delays.

## WinZO (Growth & Localization Case Study)
* **Problem:** WinZO, India's #1 casual gaming platform, faced a 70.32% bounce rate and an 18% drop in traffic because users from Tier 2-5 cities were forced to navigate an English-first interface.
* **User Insight:** The core persona, "Raj" (a junior clerk), felt alienated by the English onboarding and lack of accessible customer support, leading to trust issues and drop-offs before downloading the APK.
* **Solution:** Redesigned the onboarding flow to be "Vernacular First."
    * **Auto-Language Detection:** Proposed a feature to detect browser language settings and auto-switch the UI to one of 12 regional languages (Hindi, Gujarati, etc.).
    * **Trust Signals:** Added a visible "Customer Support" widget and a larger "20 Crore Active Users" banner to the home page to build credibility immediately.
* **Outcome:** Designed to increase the "Visit-to-Download" conversion rate by reducing linguistic friction for the target demographic.

## Style-Pronto (Fashion Q-Commerce Venture)
* **Market Opportunity:** Identified a $14 billion gap in the Indian fashion market for "Quick Commerce." While grocery Q-commerce (Blinkit/Zepto) is booming, fashion delivery still takes 24+ hours.
* **Strategy:** Proposed "Style-Pronto," a 60-minute fashion delivery service targeting the impulse-buy behavior of Gen Z and millennials.
* **Analysis:** Leveraged market data showing the Indian fashion e-commerce sector is growing at 24% CAGR, with a projected user base of 60.6 million for Q-commerce by 2029.
* **Competitive Landscape:** Positioned the product against incumbents like Myntra (slow delivery) and Blinkit (limited fashion SKU depth) by focusing purely on high-frequency fashion essentials.

## Purple Pandit (B2B Lead Generation Strategy)
* **Objective:** Developed a scalable lead generation framework for a Branding & Packaging Design Agency.
* **Methodology:** Built a targeted outreach strategy by identifying key "Buying Signals" such as recent funding rounds, new product launches, or hiring sprees, which indicate a need for rebranding services.
* **Execution:** Created a "Decision-Maker Matrix" to identify and contact the right stakeholders (CMOs, Brand Managers) rather than generic contacts.
* **Deliverable:** A comprehensive playbook covering market research, competitive analysis, and KPI definitions to streamline the agency's sales pipeline.

## Instagram (Onboarding UX Audit)
* **Research Focus:** Conducted a granular "User Journey Mapping" of the Instagram signup process to identify friction points causing drop-offs.
* **User Sentiment Analysis:** Mapped user emotions at every step (e.g., "Why do they need my date of birth?" -> *Anxiety/Hesitation*) versus the "Aha Moment" of finding friends.
* **Key Findings:** Identified that the request for personal information (DOB, Phone Number) early in the flow creates a "Privacy Barrier" before the user perceives any value from the app.
* **Recommendation:** Proposed deferring non-essential data collection until after the user has engaged with their first piece of content to improve activation rates.
